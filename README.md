# Slopes - The AVA Platform JavaScript Library

## Overview

Slopes is a JavaScript Library built using TypeScript and intended to support both browser and nodejs. 

## Building On Slopes

Slopes is available for install via npm:

`npm install --save slopes`

You can also pull the repo down directly and build it from scratch:

`npm run build`

This will generate a pure javascript library and place it in a folder named "dist" in the project root. The "slopes.js" file can then be dropped into any project as a pure javaescript implementation of Slopes.
